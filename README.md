Contributors: Haifa Nadjawi, Claude Hnafou, Erik Watson, Jay Freeman

Main Goal of the Project:

The main goal of this project is to provide insights and evidence of various tourist mobility patterns in Europe. This concentrates specifically around tourism revenues and population travel in Europe.

The first part of the data from this project comes from https://data.worldbank.org/ where data was found in different formats and the format we chose were csv files. There are 4 csv files containing information about revenues on tourism and arrivals(which accounts for tourist arrival)
the project is primarily based on data provided by https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ST.INT.RCPT.CD. The data contains tourist traces of millions of anonymized foreign visitors roaming Europe. This was detected in the form of receipts(revenues) and tourists arrivals in different European countries from 1995 -2019.

The second part of the data comes from the Techslides website where the latitude and longitude for the different countries in Europe are going to extracted.
