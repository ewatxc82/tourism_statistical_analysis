Project Name: Tourism In Europe: 1995-2019

Contributors: Haifa Nadjawi, Claude Hnafou, Erik Watson, Jay Freeman

## Project Goal:

The main goal of this project is to plot and provide insight regarding publicly available tourism data in Europe. Our main areas of concentration include the number of arrivals documented and tourism specific revenue generated for each European country available in our dataset. We seek to better understand the economic impact of tourism in various European countries over our selected time period, 1995-2019, and shed light on which countries generated the most tourist traffic and revenues.

## Data Used

- World Bank: International tourism, receipts (current US$) https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ST.INT.RCPT.CD
- World Bank: International tourism, number of arrivals https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ST.INT.ARVL
- Techslides: List of Countries and Capitals (including coordinates) http://techslides.com/list-of-countries-and-capitals

The first part of the data from this project comes from https://data.worldbank.org/ where data was found in different formats and the format we chose were csv files. There are 4 csv files containing information about revenues on tourism and arrivals(which accounts for tourist arrival)
the project is primarily based on data provided by https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ST.INT.RCPT.CD. The data contains tourist traces of millions of anonymized foreign visitors roaming Europe. This was detected in the form of receipts(revenues) and tourists arrivals in different European countries from 1995 -2019.

The second part of the data comes from the Techslides website where the latitude and longitude for the different countries in Europe are going to extracted.
